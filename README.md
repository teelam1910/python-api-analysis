## Description
Explore equatorial weather and plan vacations.
Part 1: WeatherPy Visualize weather in 500+ cities at varying distances from the equator. Utilize citipy, OpenWeatherMap API, and Python skills to create a representative model of global weather.  
Part 2: VacationPy Plan vacations using weather data. Utilize Jupyter notebooks, geoViews, and Geoapify API to create map visualizations.

## Requirements
**The requirements for "Part 1: WeatherPy" are the following:**
- Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
- Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list 
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature 
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity 
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness 
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed 

**Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship**
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude 

**The requirements for "Part 2: VacationPy" are the following**
- Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame 
- Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition 
- For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates 
- Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.


## Installation
Citipy, OpenWeatherMap API, Jupyter Notebooks, GeoViews, Geoapify API

## Usage
This project can be used to analyze and visualize weather patterns across different cities as they approach the equator, and also to plan vacations based on weather preferences.
